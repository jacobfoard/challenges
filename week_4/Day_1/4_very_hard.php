     * Red Ventures has partnered with the cable provider "Camcost" and will market and sell
     * bundles of their TV and internet packages.
     *
     * Camcost offers three TV packages:
     * "Budget" for $19.99, "Regular" for $39.99 and "Couch Potato" for $79.99.
     *
     * The "Couch Potato" package is only available in Utah and Oregon.
     *
     * Camcost offers two internet packages: "SlowNet" and "FastNet". However, the price varies depending on
     * the customer's location.
     * For customers living in North or South Carolina, "SlowNet" is $29.99 and "FastNet" is $59.99.
     * For customers anywhere else in the US, "SlowNet" is $24.99 and "FastNet" is $54.99.
     *
     * A "bundle" is considered to be the combination of one internet package and one TV package.
     * For example, "Budget + SlowNet" is a bundle combining the "Budget" TV package and the "SlowNet" internet package.
     * "Couch Potato + FastNet" is a bundle combining the "Couch Potato" TV package and the "FastNet" internet package.
     *
     * Create a class named "CamcostPricing" with a the public function: "getBundlesByZip".
     *
     * "getBundlesByZip" should take a customer's zip code and return all the possible bundles that the customer
     * is eligible for, along with the cost of each bundle.
     *
     * For example, for a customer with the zip "28277" the function should return an array that looks like:
     *
     * array(
     *     "Budget + SlowNet" => 49.98,
     *     "Budget + FastNet" => 79.98,
     *     "Regular + SlowNet" => 69.98,
     *     "Regular + FastNet" => 99.98
     * )
     *
     * This site will help you to know which zip codes belong to which states:
     * @see https://smartystreets.com/articles/zip-codes-101
